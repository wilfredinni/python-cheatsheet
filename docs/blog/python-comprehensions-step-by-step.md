_List Comprehensions_ are a special kind of syntax that let us create lists out of other lists ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension), [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions)). They are incredibly useful when dealing with numbers and with one or two levels of nested _for loops_, but beyond that, they can become a little too hard to read.

In this article, we are going to make some _For Loops_ and rewrite them, step by step, into _Comprehensions_.

## Basics

The truth is, _List Comprehensions_ are not too complex, but they are still a bit difficult to understand at first because they look a _little_ weird. Why? Well, the order in which they are written is the **_opposite_** of what we usually see in a _For Loop_.

```python
>>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
>>> for n in names:
...     print(n)
# Charles
# Susan
# Patrick
# George
# Carol
```

To do the same with a _List Comprehension_, we start at the very end of the _loop_:

```python
>>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
>>> [print(n) for n in names]
# Charles
# Susan
# Patrick
# George
# Carol
```

Notice how we inverted the order:

- First, we have what the output of the loop will be `[print(n) ...]`.
- Then we define the variable that will store each of the items and point at the `List`, `Set` or `Dictionary` we will work on `[... for n in names]`.

## Creating a new List with a Comprehension

> This is the primary use of a _List Comprehension_. Other usages may result in a hard-to-read code for you and others.

This is how we create a new list from an existing collection with a _For Loop_:

```python
>>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']

>>> new_list = []
>>> for n in names:
...     new_list.append(n)

>>> print(new_list)
# ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
```

And this is how we do the same with a _List Comprehension_:

```python
>>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
>>> new_list = [n for n in names]
>>> print(new_list)
# ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
```

The reason we can do this is that a _List Comprehension_ standard behavior is to return a list:

```python
>>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
>>> [n for n in names]
# ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
```

## Adding Conditionals

What if we want `new_list` to have only the names that start with `C`? With a _For Loop_, we would do it like this:

```python
>>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']

>>> new_list = []
>>> for n in names:
...     if n.startswith('C'):
...         new_list.append(n)

>>> print(new_list)
# ['Charles', 'Carol']
```

In a _List Comprehension_, we add the if statement at its end:

```python
>>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
>>> new_list = [n for n in names if n.startswith('C')]
>>> print(new_list)
# ['Charles', 'Carol']
```

A lot more readable.

## Formatting long List Comprehensions

This time, we want `new_list` to have not only the names that start with a `C` but also those that end with an `e` and contain a `k`:

```python
>>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
>>> new_list = [n for n in names if n.startswith('C') or n.endswith('e') or 'k' in n]
>>> print(new_list)
# ['Charles', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
```

That is quite messy. Fortunately, it is possible to break _Comprehensions_ in different lines:

```python
new_list = [
    n
    for n in names
    if n.startswith("C")
    or n.endswith("e")
    or "k" in n
]
```

## Set and Dict Comprehensions

If you learned the basics of _List Comprehensions_... Congratulations! You just did it with <router-link to="/cheatsheet/sets">Sets</router-link> and <router-link to="/cheatsheet/dictionaries">Dictionaries</router-link>.

### Set comprehension

```python
>>> my_set = {"abc", "def"}

>>> # Here, we create a new set with uppercase elements with a for loop
>>> new_set = set()
>>> for s in my_set:
...    new_set.add(s.upper())
>>> print(new_set)
# {'DEF', 'ABC'}

>>> # The same, but with a set comprehension
>>> new_set = {s.upper() for s in my_set}
>>> print(new_set)
# {'DEF', 'ABC'}
```

### Dict comprehension

```python
>>> my_dict = {'name': 'Christine', 'age': 98}

>>> # A new dictionary out of an existing one with a for loop
>>> new_dict = {}
>>> for key, value in my_dict.items():
...     new_dict[key] = value
>>> print(new_dict)
# {'name': 'Christine', 'age': 98}

# Using a dict comprehension
>>> new_dict = {key: value for key, value in my_dict.items()}  # Notice the ":"
>>> print(new_dict)
# {'name': 'Christine', 'age': 98}
```

## Conclusion

Every time I learn something new, there is this urge to use it right away. When that happens, I force myself to stop and think for a moment... Should I change this big, nested and already messy looking _For Loop_ to a _List Comprehension_? Probably not.
